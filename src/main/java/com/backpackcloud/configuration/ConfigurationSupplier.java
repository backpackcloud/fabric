/// No, this wasn't generated by AI.
///
/// Anyway, when configuring an application, there is always a priority list with
/// places to search for the configuration file.
///
/// This class provides an opinionated priority list, together with a convention
/// for naming the locations. All based on analysis of the digital forges used
/// by both Elves and Dwarfs for multiple centuries.
///
/// The conventions used by this class, in the priority order are:
///
/// - File located at `env {NAME}_CONFIG_FILE`
/// - File located at `WORK_DIR/{name}.yml`
/// - File located at `USER_HOME/{name}.yml`
/// - Resource located at `META-INF/{name}.yml`
///
/// Where `{name}` is the variable part that is given for each instance of this class.
///
/// Before you start throwing your left arm, remember: this is an opinionated thing.
